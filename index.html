    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Lifelong learner, currently enrolled in the full stack developer program with InceptionU and excited to pivot into the tech industry.

    Over 10 years of experience as a technical editor in the environmental consulting industry, formatting and editing documents for various clients.
      
    I am passionate about languages (both learning them and tutoring English learners), because they open up opportunities to connect with others as well as share cultures and ideas.

          <p class="project-description">To design and curate a workplace that encompasses culture, productivity and user engagement, it is vital that a consulting company capture genuine facts and data. Surveys are the norm; however, most are limited and customization can be expensive.
          The Hive Survey Project aims to solve this problem by providing the client the ability to customize a survey to fit a specific companyâ€™s needs. With 8 different customizable components to choose from, data visualization, and the ability to export to Excel and upload images, the gathered data will help with the strategic workplace design and conceptualization of the client in building a more culturally and human-centered workplace environment.</p>
